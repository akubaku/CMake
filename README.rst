test You need to have a compiler and a make installed.
test Run the ``bootstrap`` script you find in the source directory of CMake.
test You can use the ``--help`` option to see the supported options.
test You may use the ``--prefix=<install_prefix>`` option to specify a custom
test installation directory for CMake. You can run the ``bootstrap`` script from
test within the CMake source directory or any other build directory of your
test choice. Once this has finished successfully, run ``make`` and
test ``make install``.  In summary::
test
test  $ ./bootstrap && make && make install

test run the installed CMake on the sources of this CMake with your preferred
test options and generators. Then build it and install it.
test For instructions how to do this, see documentation on `Running CMake`_.
